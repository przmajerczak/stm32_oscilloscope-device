INTERFACE

1.0 The device sends single conversion result every ~10 ms.
    Data format is raw 12-bit ADC result sent as 5 chars:
    four ASCII digits and newline symbol. Zeroes on the front
    are replaced with spaces.

2.0 The device sends 800 conversion results during one transmission.
    Less significant byte is sent first, followed by more significant one.
    After all 1600 bytes of results comes end sequence, consisting of 
    0xa ('\n') and 0xff. ADC measurement occurs every 125 Âµs, resulting in
    sampling frequency of 8 kHz.
